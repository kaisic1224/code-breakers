# Codebreakers
Codebreakers is a game where users have to guess a colour code that is set by another player. Our application (designed in Java and Java Swing) allows the user to guess the code set by an AI. Additionally, the player can set a code and the AI will guess it in 5 turns using Donal Knuth's five-guess algorithm. We also implemented a variety of other features including an account management system that stores user info and high scores as fully encrypted data, and the number of guesses the AI will take to solve every colour code combination.
